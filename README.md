    if a[i][i] == 0.0:
        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected')
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        ratio = a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]
X[n-1] = a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]
for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    X[i] = a[i][n]
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        X[i] = X[i] - a[i][j]*X[j]
    X[i] = X[i]/a[i][i]
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.2f' %(i,X[i]), end = ' ')

## Output:
!Gaussian.png()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
